**Author**: Andrew R. Phillips

**Affiliation**: Drexel University, College of Arts and Sciences, Philadelphia PA

**Date**: September 2021

This project was created over the course of six months from April 2021 to September 2021 while I worked as a research assistant within Drexel University's department of mathematics.
The purpose of this project is to provide simulations of several different types of neuronal models. The types included are the Morris-lecar model, the Fitzhugh Nagumo model, and 
the Saddle-Node Infinite Period (SNIPER) model.
